Hierarchical data does a good job of providing an organizational framework
for information. We use hierarchical structures in file systems, the DNS system,
JSON, XML, and NoSQL data stores. It then seems a safe bet to assume that
SAFE app authors will want to store hierarchical data blobs on the network.

Consider an image sharing app in which each user has a profile. Each user
profile can be stored in a tree of information about the user which has
a standard structure. A link to the root node of the profile can be appended
to some app specific (this can be done with appendable data).
