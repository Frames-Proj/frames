# Sponsorship

Brett Russell, James Bach, Nicholas Koteskey, and Stephan Pilsl,
members of the SAFEnet community have agreed to sponsor our project.
They are all interested and enthusiastic about the implications of
a distributed peer-to-peer network like the SAFEnet, and are willing
to provide their time in order to help grow the SAFE ecosystem.

Our sponsors are mostly located near the Prime Meridian, so we will
have to meet and coordinate online. We plan on using video chat services
such as Google Hangouts and Skype to hold these remote meetings, and we
will keep a written record of our activity to ensure that our sponsors
have enough visibility into the project.

We currently have an online meeting planned to discuss our thoughts on
the implications of the SAFEnet and get the input of our sponsors. Networks
like the SAFEnet are very new, so much of the value our sponsors will bring
to the project will be in helping us refine our ideas about it. All of them
have been actively involved in the SAFE community for some time, and have
had ample opportunity to think deeply about the network.
