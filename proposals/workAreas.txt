# Work Areas

The SAFE Network is poised to make a big difference in how developers
write safe, reliable applications.  It is, however, still in its alpha
stage of development.  This means that there is not much documentation
for the software that already exists, and what does exist is relatively
sparse.  Furthermore, there are not many developers in the world who
have an active base of knowledge about the SAFE Network.

Our project would help to bring a cutting-edge piece of technology closer
to maturity.  We would do this by learning the nuances of working with
SAFEnet and contributing to the community's documentation, effectively
paving the way for future SAFEnet developers.  Another way that our
project would contribute to the growth of SAFEnet is by demonstrating a
valid use case for SAFEnet along with a workable solution to that problem.
